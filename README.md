The project was worked on to fully or partially lead trading accounts to profits.
This is a project to create a Trading bot in MQL5 and connect it to a trained AI model for predictions or analysis
It involves the use of several algorithms and actions by the bot, as well as Socket connections between the bot and the "MEAServer"

The Server runs on the same PC as the Trading bot.

The next step is to either scrape live market data or history, for a certain time frame...or... Let the ML model begin its analysis.

If you decide to scrape, then make sure to activate the Scraper Bot in your broker's software, else activate the Trader Bot to begin actual trading.

If your previous step was to scrape, then make sure to run the training script to create your new model and save to your desired file

The Trading Agent can be given Stop Losses or Take Profparametersers and others like margins, candles to analyze, etc.

The Most Consistent Result was from trading EUR/USD (approached about 60% profit with the right parameters [start:$100, end:$158-$160])
BTC/USD had high profits at times but was unstable during certain times for live tests
