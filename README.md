# AI-Ml-Forex-Trading-bot by Joel Assiakwa
The project was worked on to fully or partially lead trading accounts to profits.
This is a project to create a Trading bot in MQL5 and connect it to a trained AI model for predictions or analysis
It involves the use of several algorithms and actions by the bot, as well as Socket connections between the bot and the "MEAServer"

The Server runs on the same PCcal PC as the trading bot
The Trading Agent can be given Stop Losses or Take Profparametersers as well as others like margins, candles to analyze, etc.
